## Project Description

Tripinary is an AI-assisted trip planning tool that generates personalized itineraries based on the user's city of choice and duration of stay. Our application uses these user inputs to generate suggestions of activities that the user can pick from. For example, the user can choose from a carousel of restaurants, outdoor activities, cultural events, etc., and the website will compile an itinerary for them based on these preferences. The itinerary will contain a list of time stamped activities that the user can follow each day, consisting of selection preferences from earlier. At the bottom of this itinerary page, there is a prompt box that allows the user to regenerate their itinerary. Once users are satisfied with their itinerary, they can press on individual activities, which will take them to a slide-out page containing a map of the activity on their itinerary and the latest five reviews of that specific activity. 

Our application focuses on helping users plan trips and create daily itineraries. The application targets students, hobbyists, locals, and avid travellers with features specifically tailored to their unique preferences.

Our team came up with this idea because our group consists of international students and travel enthusiasts who like to go on trips. We often have places we want to go, but planning certain activities at each destination can be time consuming and overwhelming. Tripinary is an important app because it allows travellers to plan trips all in one place without having to search through reviews and sites just to find a few good options. Our app has AI-generated itineraries and maps to activities based on individual user preferences. This not only saves time but also encourages people to discover new destinations they might not have considered.
